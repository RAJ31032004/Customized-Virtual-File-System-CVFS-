The Customised Virtual File System (CVFS) is an in-memory simulation of the Linux File System developed using the C programming language.

This project implements core file system operations such as file creation, deletion, reading, writing and listing using OS concepts like Inodes, Super Block, File Table and UFDT.

All file operations are performed virtually in RAM without using actual disk storage.
