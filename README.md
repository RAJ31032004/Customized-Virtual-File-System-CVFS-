Customized-Virtual-File-System-CVFS-
1.The Customised Virtual File System (CVFS) is a simulation of the Linux File System developed using the C programming language.
This project demonstrates the internal working of operating system file management such as:

File Creation

File Deletion

File Reading

File Writing

File Listing

Permission Handling

2.It provides an in-memory implementation of file system components like:

Boot Block

Super Block

Inodes

File Table

User File Descriptor Table (UFDT)

This system works similar to Linux system calls but without using actual disk storage.
All file operations are performed in RAM (Virtual Environment)
